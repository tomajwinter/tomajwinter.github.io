I'm an experienced software engineer who has worked in a variety of teams and across the entire stack.

I enjoy using a range of tools to translate product & project requirements into robust, scalable and maintainable software.

I have experience leading technical decision making & implementation, working with stakeholders and mentoring others.

I care about building software that helps people as part of teams that are open, inclusive and supportive
